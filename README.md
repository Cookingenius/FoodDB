This will contain a json database per language and divided by food type of core foods + supplements (only macros for now).  

Every macro will be for 100g or a unit (like 1 egg, 1 banana etc) of the given food after cooking (except for things like rice where there will be both the cooked and
uncooked macros).

If a food has a weight element, it means the macro are for 1 unit of that food.
The weight is the average weight of that unit.
